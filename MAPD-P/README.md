# Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery with Task Probability Distribution (MAPD-P)
<p align="justify">
This repo contains implementations of various algorithms used to solve the problem of Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery based on Token Passing and using a task probability distribution.
The implementation of base token passing is based on [this](https://github.com/Lodz97/Multi-Agent_Pickup_and_Delivery) implementation.
